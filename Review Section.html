I came across a couple videos from Jordan. Started watching all the free ones then purchased his masters course. For the price of the course and what you get from it is tremendous. I filled 3 claims and got back a 60% rating from the VA! I'm currently waiting on 2 more claims to go through the whole VA waiting process.
